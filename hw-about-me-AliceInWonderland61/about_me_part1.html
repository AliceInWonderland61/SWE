            <h2> Hello there! My name is Alissen D. Moreno and I was born here in Mcallen, Texas (I've basically lived here all of my life). 
                My parents both attended Highschool in La Joya and I have two younger siblings. 
                I'm currently pursuing Computer Science due to a misunderstanding between my Professor and I back in Highschool and it's honestly been quite a rollercoaster. 
                If all goes well, then I should graduate by the end of this year! 

               <h2><p>I'm planning on continuing with my Masters Degree after I graduate but I'm unsure if to start the program here in UTRGV or Notre Dame. 
                I'm currently in a group project with a friend I had made back in my Game Dev class. We've been working on small games and perfecting our previous games. 
                It's been a bit difficult to set a scheduled time to finish our started projects, but we've slowly been updating them. Right now we have an instagram page and we're agreeing on what 
            dates we should upload our progress videos.  </p></h2> 

            <h2> <p>As far as my interests go with CS, I had leaned more towards hardware rather than software. I use to repair computers and phones on the side to help pay for books and stuff. 
                However as classes became progressively more time consuming, I've had to turn away clients since I can no longer fit them in my schedule.

            <h2> Entertainment Recommendations: </h2>
            <p> <b>1. Music wise I really enjoy listening to NF! His music is quite dark but it honestly energises me when I feel like giving up. 
                    He raps with raw emotion that just makes you realize life isn't that bad and I can accomplish anything if I really put in the work. 
                There's a few songs I have on repeat which are 'Grindin', 'NO NAME', 'The Search' and 'HOPE'.  </b>
            <p> <b> <i> I kind of like any kind of genre I'm not super picky, but if you want a boost of motivation NF is the way to go!  </i></p>

            <p> <b> 2. I'm a huge fan of comedic movies and crime show. 
                Some of the shows i'd recommend is Scorpion, The Mentalist, Criminal Minds, Sweet Home (I read the comic way before it became a series and it was pretty good ngl),
                Avatar: The Last Airbender ( childhood favorite) and One Punch Man (My friend insisted I watch it with him and it became one of my favorites because of how ridiculous it was lol) </b>
                <p> <b> <i> I absolutely hate any movies/shows that are sad or show injustice. I've tried to sit through those kinds of genres, but I really can't. 
                    The only exception was the movie Encanto. I was legit bawling the entire time but I couldn't stop rewatching it! </i></p>
