            <h2>
                Hello there! My name is Alissen D. Moreno and I was born here in Mcallen, Texas (I've basically lived here all of my life). 
                My parents both attended Highschool in La Joya and I have two younger siblings. 
                I'm currently pursuing Computer Science due to a misunderstanding between my Professor and I back in Highschool and it's honestly been quite a rollercoaster. 
                If all goes well, then I should graduate by the end of this year! 
                <h2><p>I'm planning on continuing with my Masters Degree after I graduate but I'm unsure if to start the program here in UTRGV or Notre Dame. 
                    I'm currently in a group project with a friend I had made back in my Game Dev class. We've been working on small games and perfecting our previous games. 
                    It's been a bit difficult to set a scheduled time to finish our started projects, but we've slowly been updating them. Right now we have an instagram page and we're agreeing on what 
                dates we should upload our progress videos.  </p></h2> 
    
                <h2> <p>As far as my interests go with CS, I had leaned more towards hardware rather than software. I use to repair computers and phones on the side to help pay for books and stuff. 
                    However as classes became progressively more time consuming, I've had to turn away clients since I can no longer fit them in my schedule.
